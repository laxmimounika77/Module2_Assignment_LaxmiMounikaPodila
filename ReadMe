A responsive website has been demonstarted in this project.

Layout: In the mobile view (equal to or less than 767px), each section should take up the entire row. 
Layout: In the desktop view (992px and above), each of the 3 sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen. As you make the browser window 
wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower. 
Layout: In the tablet view (between 768px and 991px, inclusively), the first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal size.
The 3rd section should be in the second row and take up the entire row by itself.
